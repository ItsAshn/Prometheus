# Theme System Fix - Restart Required

## 🔧 What Was Fixed

The theme system wasn't loading because:

1. ❌ `root.tsx` was importing `global.css` statically
2. ❌ Static CSS was overriding dynamic theme CSS
3. ❌ Wrong method for injecting dynamic CSS

## ✅ Changes Made

1. **Removed static CSS import** from `src/root.tsx`
2. **Added `useStyles$()`** to properly inject theme CSS in `layout.tsx`
3. **Added debug logging** to `theme-utils.ts` to track theme loading

## 🚀 How to Test

### 1. Restart Dev Server

Stop the current dev server and restart it:

```powershell
# In your terminal, press Ctrl+C to stop the server
# Then run:
pnpm dev
```

### 2. Visit Your Site

Open http://localhost:5173 in your browser

### 3. Check Browser Console

You should see logs like:

```
[Theme Utils] Loading theme config: { selectedTemplate: 'modern', hasCustomCss: false }
[Theme Utils] Loading theme template: modern
[Theme Utils] Theme content loaded, length: 12345
```

### 4. Test Theme Switching

1. Go to http://localhost:5173/admin
2. Login with your credentials
3. Click "Site Configuration"
4. Scroll to "Theme Templates"
5. Click "Apply" on a different theme
6. Refresh the page
7. Theme should change!

## 🎨 How It Works Now

```
Page Load
    ↓
layout.tsx useThemeLoader() runs (server-side)
    ↓
getCurrentThemeCSS() reads temp/site-config.json
    ↓
Theme CSS file loaded from src/themes/
    ↓
useStyles$() injects CSS into page <head>
    ↓
Theme appears!
```

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Still no theme showing?

1. **Check browser console** for the debug logs
2. **Check server terminal** for theme loading logs
3. **Clear browser cache** (Ctrl+Shift+Delete)
4. **Hard refresh** (Ctrl+F5)

### Themes not switching?

1. After clicking "Apply", **refresh the page**
2. Check `temp/site-config.json` to verify theme was saved
3. Look for "Theme content loaded" in server logs

### CSS looking broken?

1. Make sure you **restarted the dev server**
2. Check that theme files exist in `src/themes/`
3. Verify no browser extensions are blocking styles

## 📝 File Changes Summary

### Modified:

- `src/root.tsx` - Removed `global.css` import
- `src/routes/layout.tsx` - Added `useStyles$()` for dynamic CSS

### No Changes Needed:

- `src/components/admin/site-config-manager.tsx` - Already updated
- `src/themes/*.css` - Theme files unchanged

## ✅ Expected Result

After restarting the dev server:

- ✅ Modern theme should load by default
- ✅ All CSS variables and styles should work
- ✅ Theme switching should work immediately
- ✅ Console logs should show theme loading
- ✅ Page should look styled and complete
